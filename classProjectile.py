# instead of animating something new or creating functionality for a projectile cell
# just change the visual of the cell for each "frame" to reflect
# a path that it is traveling.

# for instance, maybe a cell could reflect a explosion for the 'projectile'
# In the drawings the arrow and food cells aren't too far apart, so just displaying
# an explosion graphic could show the projectile 'shooting' at the gopher
